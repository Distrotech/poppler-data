{"name":"Poppler-data","tagline":"Mirror of git://anongit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler-data","body":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-*- text -*-\r\npoppler-data\r\n\r\nThis package consists of encoding files for use with poppler.  The\r\nencoding files are optional and poppler will automatically read them\r\nif they are present.  When installed, the encoding files enables\r\npoppler to correctly render CJK and Cyrrilic properly.  While poppler\r\nis licensed under the GPL, these encoding files have different license, \r\nand thus distributed separately.\r\n\r\nAll the Makefile does is install the data files, so autotools seemed a\r\nbit overkill.  There is no ./configure file, all there is to do is to\r\nsay 'make install'.  To override the install destinations, specify\r\nprefix, datadir, pkgdatadir or DESTDIR at 'make install' time as\r\ndesired.  For example:\r\n\r\n\t$ make install datadir=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/buildroot-xyz2000\r\n\r\nwill install the files under /usr/share/poppler in a temporary build\r\nroot.\r\n\r\n                                                Kristian HÃ¸gsberg <krh@redhat.com>\r\n                                                Updated by: Albert Astals Cid <aacid@kde.org>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
